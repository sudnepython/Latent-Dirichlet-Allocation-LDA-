Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Topic modeling is a type of statistical modeling for discovering the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an example of topic model and is used to classify text in a document to a particular topic. It builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions.
Here we are going to apply LDA to a set of documents and split them into topics. Let’s get started!
